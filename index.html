    { title: "Bike Accident Anxiety", content: "We were in Bend, driving nowhere in particular, when suddenly a biker was in our path (I swear we had the right of way). We were in a stage where you were finally sharing your anxious thoughts with me, and your vulnerability sent me over the edge. I thought I loved you before then, but in that moment when you were worried you were being too much (you could never be too much), I knew for certain. When we finally made it to the healthy fast food spot, I cried in the bathroom because I was so in love with you and I wanted to tell you so badly. Your anxiety always gave you pause, but for me, it's one of the main reasons I love you." },
      { title: "One More", content: "We were in Philly, and we had just gotten our warm (delicious) pretzels. We sat down to eat them, and Lauren started taking photos of you, me, Michael, and Cooper. She was about to put her phone down when you said, Wait, take one more, and you got up from your seat, pretzel in hand, and put your head on my head. You wanted to take a picture with me, and I swear my heart melted 🥹. I had never felt so desired by you. My heart still beats faster when I look at that photo of us." },
      { title: "Attachment Style Quizzes", content: "You ended things with me the day before, and naturally, I invited you over for dinner (because we are silly gooses). After we ate, we both sat on my couch and took quizzes that would help us identify our attachment styles. We read each other's results aloud to one another, saying each other's name before every bullet point, and we were cracking up the entire time. My heart fluttered at your interest in my wiring, your own attachment curiosity, and the vulnerability you showed that night. Even though things had ended the night before, I wrote in my journal - I think I might marry Matt. And truthfully, I still believe I will." },
      { title: "Tahoe Phone Call", content: "We were in the early stages, barely getting to know one another, when you had to go to Tahoe for a wedding. I decided to start sending you voice memos because I wanted to hear your voice (tbh), and to my surprise, you kept sending them back! These voice memos were actually the first time you paid me a compliment (it was about my eyes). You attended the wedding and sent me some hiking photos (per my request, but still gave you major points in my book), and on the way home, you decided to call me. I honestly have no idea what we were talking about, but it was just so nice to chat with you on the phone about nothing and everything while you drove back. The phone call only ended because you pulled into the complex and parked the car. We sat on my balcony, used my binoculars, and laughed and laughed. The first photo I took of you was of you with those binoculars. Gosh, I thought you were so damn hot (and I absolutely still do). PS. Christina made that reel of the Tahoe wedding, and I swear I watched the part where you wink over 100 times, and I had to pretend I hadn’t seen it when you showed it to me. " },
      { title: "My Valentine", content: "It was Valentine’s Day 2024, and you rang my doorbell to pick me up for our Calistoga dinner date. I didn’t see it live, but my Ring camera recorded you. When I played it back, I got to see you adjusting your suit and the flowers in your hand to make sure you were perfectly presentable for me. Not only that, but you wore the suit for me 😭🥹🔥. I cannot tell you how many times I have watched that video. You melt my damn heart! " },
      { title: "Calistoga Pop Up", content: "The Happy Hippy had a pop-up at Calistoga Motor Lodge, and not only did you show up, but you showed up with canned goods you purchased for the canned food drive 😭 How could anyone not love this thoughtful man? " },
      { title: "down in the valley", content: "Laughing until your stomach hurt over something silly." },
